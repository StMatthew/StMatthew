## PROJECTS
I'm constantly whipping up projects to hone my skills. Here are a few highlights:

1. **Revibe: Multimodal Affective Personalized Music Recommender (Thesis)**
   - [Link to Repository](link_to_repository_here)
   - Description: Developed server-side logic for "Revibe," a web application providing personalized music recommendations based on multimodal affective data. Integrated machine learning and AI algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for user input processing and tailored recommendations. Ensured application functionality, scalability, and data management efficiency.
     
1. **VulnTrack - A Vulnerability Management System**
   - [Link to Repository](link_to_repository_here)
   - Description: VulnTrack is a web-based Vulnerability Management System built using Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL. automates the process of identifying, tracking, and reporting on security vulnerabilities within an organization's IT infrastructure. VulnTrack integrates with vulnerability scanners, manages asset information, generates comprehensive reports, and provides user authentication and authorization. Advanced features could include automated remediation tracking, ticketing system integration, vulnerability prioritization, machine learning for anomaly detection, and a RESTful API. It's a complex project designed to provide a centralized platform for managing cybersecurity risks.

1. **ATTENTION-CNN MODEL FOR CLASSIFYING SYNTHETIC IMAGES USING THE CIFAKE DATASET: IMAGE CLASSIFICATION OF AI-GENERATED SYNTHETIC IMAGES**
   - [Link to Repository](link_to_repository_here)
   - Description: Our project focused on making a computer program better at telling the difference between real photos and fake ones made by AI. We took an existing program and changed it to make it much more accurate. Now, it can correctly identify fake images about 95% of the time, which is a big improvement from its original 70% accuracy.
With AI now able to create very convincing fake images quickly (Khadatkar, 2024), our work is important for spotting these fakes. 1 Our research paper explains how we made these improvements using a special kind of computer learning. This work can help address the challenges that come with the rise of AI-generated images.

1. **Automated Defective Product Detection System on a Production Line**
   - [Link to Repository](link_to_repository_here)
   - Description: Developed a deep learning model for real-time image analysis to identify and flag defective products on a production line. Automated quality control processes to minimize manual inspection.

1. **Personalized Recipe Recommendation App Base on Dietary Restrictions and Preferences**
   - [Link to Repository](link_to_repository_here)
   - Description: Designed an application providing tailored recipe suggestions based on userdefined allergies, dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegam, gluten-free), and cuisine
preferences.

1. **Automated Web Application Security Scanner for Common Vulnerabilities**
   - [Link to Repository](link_to_repository_here)
   - Description: Designed a tool for pre-deployment website security assessments. Automated probing for vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting. Generated reports detailing security flaws for developer remediation, similar to vulnerability scanners used in security audits.

1. **Real-time Network Traffic Anomaly Detector**
   - [Link to Repository](link_to_repository_here)
   - Description:Developed a lightweight background program for real-time network traffic analysis, identifying anomalies such as data spikes, suspicious IP connections,
and protocol irregularities.

1. **Smart Inventory Management System for a Small Business**
   - [Link to Repository](link_to_repository_here)
   - Description:Developed a web application for efficient product management, including inventory tracking, low-stock alerts, and sales report generation. Enabled small businesses to optimize stock levels, helping them to avoid running out of fast-moving items and not overstock on slow-moving ones.
